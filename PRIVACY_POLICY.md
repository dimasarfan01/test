# Privacy Policy for [Shura POS]

**Effective Date: [Today's Date, e.g., December 15, 2025]**

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which **dimasarfan01** (the "Developer" or "I"), an individual solo developer, provides and operates the **[Shura POS]** mobile application (the "App").

---

## 1. Developer Identity

- **Developer Name:** dimasarfan01 (Individual Developer)
- **Contact:** [dimasarfanasyuro123@gmail.com]

---

## 2. Data Collection Policy (Zero-Data Model)

**The Developer does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data from your device.**

- **No Personal Information Collection:** The App does not collect any personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, location, phone number) for the Developer's use.
- **No Third-Party SDKs:** The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or crash reporting services (SDKs) that might collect data.
- **Data Stored Locally:** All business-related data generated by the user (products, sales, customers, loyalty points) is **stored exclusively on the user's device** in a local database. This data never leaves your device unless you manually use the built-in Backup/Export feature.
- **No Cloud Sync:** The App does not sync any user-generated data to any cloud service, server, or external service operated by the Developer.

---

## 3. On-Device Access (Data Handled Locally)

While the App does not collect data, it must access and use data _on your device_ to function.

- **Local Data Access:** The App accesses and processes the user's business data (inventory, sales, customers) only _on the device_ to provide core POS functionality. This is solely for app functionality and is not collected by the Developer.
- **Permissions:** The App may request necessary permissions (e.g., Storage access for the Backup/Restore feature) for on-device operations only.

---

## 4. Log Data

I want to inform you that in a case of an error in the App, the operating system (Android) and Google Play may collect data and information (through third-party products like Google Play Services) on your device called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, and other device statistics. **The Developer does not directly access or control this Log Data.**

---

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

---

## 6. Your Data Rights & Contact

Because the Developer does not collect or store any of your data, all data deletion and management is controlled by the user via the App's built-in features (e.g., deleting a customer record) or by simply uninstalling the App.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact me directly at: **[dimasarfanasyuro123@gmail.com]**
